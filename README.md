# Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Ecological Data
### Graduate Program in Ecology and Biodiversity, UNESP - SÃ£o Paulo State University, Rio Claro, Brazil

This is the home of the postgraduate course in "Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Ecological Data", offered by the Graduate Program in Ecology and Biodiversity, UNESP-Rio Claro. 

### Course Overview

This course will (hopefully) teach you how to *think* statistically. Unlike most statistical courses, this will not be a "buffet" of statistical tests (that usually paired with flowchart of "how to choose your test"ðŸ˜± - I loathe statistical "testing").

If we succeed in this course, you should be able to *understand* enough statistical thinking to indentify, learn and apply any statistical analysis, to any ecological data. The keyword here is *understanding*, meaning **not** blindly following a recipe without really understanding what you' re doing. Sadly, statistics is not like cooking.

The course is usually delivered as a mixture of live streaming and recorded lectures. There are also practical exercises for each lecture, which **must** be done using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Understand what is a random variable and its associated probability distribution

- Understand the difference between a random variable and a computed statistic

- Understand the current logic behind frequentist statistical tests

- Understand what a p-value is and isn't, and why it is so commonly misused

- Use p-values and confidence intervals as a measure of *relative uncertainty*

- Organize your projects and data

- Summarize and visualize your data to maximize information communication

- Use general linear models to model multivariate data

- Understand the basics of randomization methods as an alternative to parametric estimation

- Understand the basics of machine learning for data analysis and prediction
