# Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Ecological Data
### Graduate Program in Ecology and Biodiversity
#### UNESP - SÃ£o Paulo State University, Rio Claro, Brazil

This is the home of the postgraduate course in "Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Ecological Data", offered by the [Graduate Program in Ecology and Biodiversity](http://ib.rc.unesp.br/#!/departamentos/ecologia/pos-graduacao-em-ecologia-e-biodiversidade/),
[IB - UNESP Rio Claro](http://ib.rc.unesp.br/). 

### Course Overview

This course will (hopefully) teach you how to *think* statistically. Unlike most statistical courses, this will not be a "buffet" of statistical tests (usually paired with a flowchart of "how to choose your test" :man_facepalming:). Null hypothesis testing is almost useless, as you will learn in this course.

If we succeed over these two weeks, you should be able to *understand* enough statistical thinking to indentify, learn and apply any statistical analysis to any ecological data. The keyword here is *understanding*, meaning **not** blindly following a recipe without really understanding what you are doing. Sadly, statistics is not like cooking.

The course is usually delivered as a mixture of live streaming and recorded lectures. There are also practical exercises for each lecture, which **must** be done using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Understand what is a random variable and its associated probability distribution

- Understand the difference between a random variable and a computed statistic

- Understand the current logic behind frequentist statistical tests

- Understand what a p-value is and isn't, and why it is so commonly misused

- Use p-values and confidence intervals as a measure of *relative uncertainty*

- Organize your projects and data

- Summarize and visualize your data to maximize information communication

- Use general linear models to model multivariate data

- Understand the basics of randomization methods as an alternative to parametric estimation

- Understand the basics of machine learning for data analysis and prediction
