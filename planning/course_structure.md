### SAMED planning

- **Lecture 1** : "*If you're doing statistics without philosophy, you're doing it wrong (McGill)*"

  - Basic principles of the philosophy and epistemology of science:

    - What is knowledge and uncertainty?
    - Inference: induction, deduction, abduction
    - The philosophies that shaped our modern view: Popper, Khun, etc.

  - Why do we care about statistics?

    - Statistics = quantifying uncertainty
    - The frequentist view: converging on the hidden truth
    - The Bayesian view: updating your beliefs

  - Everything is a model: assessing uncertainty by comparing and updating models

    - What is a model?

    - Why use models?

    - Any statistic is a model

    - Model comparison: a common ground between frequentists and Bayesians?

      ​

- **Lecture 2** : *"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence (proverb)"*

  - Using probabilities to represent uncertainties (or certainties)

  - The deceptively simple rules of probability

  - Random variables and probability distributions

    - Why define a probability distribution? Because they have know properties!
      - Expectation, variance, support
    - We don't  *find* the distribution of data, we *assign* it
    - How to use distributions to model problems



  - - Simulating probabilistic outcomes
    - From the distribution of data to the distribution of a *parameter* 
    - Combining distributions to simulate complex processes

    ​

- **Lecture 3** : *"All models are wrong, some are useful (Box)"* 

  - From simulation to fitting: when the data comes first
    - What does it mean to *fit* a model?
      - Fitting parameters
      - Estimating uncertainty
    - Analytic solutions: once they were all we had
  - Maximum Likelihood: the probabilities that are not probabilities
  - Randomization and resampling:  let the data speak
    - Jacknife and Bootstrap: something from nothing

    - Monte Carlo methods in general

      ​

- **Lecture 4**: "Judgment is not invited (Gigerenzer)" 


  - What is a hypothesis?
  - What does it mean to test hypotheses?
  - Do we always need a hypothesis?
  - Popper, Platt
  - Hypotheses as models

    - Hypotheses in the frequentist view

      - What is a p-value? What does it measure?
      - The cult of significance
    - Hypotheses in the Bayesian view
  - The trend of unimportant, uninformative hypotheses

    - The Earth is round, p <0.05, Is there a difference, mindless statistics, the difference between significant and non significant results is not significant
  - Model comparison revisited

    - Anderson and Burham
